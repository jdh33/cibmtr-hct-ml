# cibmtr-hct-ml

Analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling of synthetic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival data. The predictions produced by the trained models will be submitted to Kaggle for the “CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions” competition. The goal of the competition is to improve prediction of transplant survival rates equitably for allogeneic HCT patients.

Competition overview: In this competition, you’ll develop models to improve the prediction of transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) — an important step in ensuring that every patient has a fair chance at a successful outcome, regardless of their background.
